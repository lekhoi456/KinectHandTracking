Abstract: We propose a gestures recognition system based on Microsoft Kinect version 2 sensors. Our research identifies 6 gestures applied to control the slideshows support for teaching. We tested this system about 1800 samples. The results show that the identification system with over 95% accuracy, even in difficult conditions such as poor lighting, many garbage objects, etc. Combine with holographic, the research brings the most visual feeling about teaching a presentation, especially in 3D-related lessons. Thereby enhancing the ability to acquire and create strong interest for learners.
